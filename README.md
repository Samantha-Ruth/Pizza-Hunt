# Pizza-Hunt

## Description
This app utilizes the NOSQL database MongoDB and the ODM Mongoose!  The technologies included are node.js and express. This app lets individuals share their favorite pizza creations, react to other friends' pizzas, and allows friends to comment on each other's pizzas.

This application introduced me to NOSQL databases and how they are a different resource from relational databases.  I learned how to install MongoDB and Mongoose, how to initiate the Mongo shell, how to create collections, fields, and documents that interelate to one another using subdocuments and nested arrays.
